# The Code Catastrophe Chronicles 📚

## Introduction
Welcome to the Code Catastrophe Chronicles, where we delve into the wonderful world of coding under the not-so-watchful eye of our "illustrious" teacher, Mr. Big. 🦖 Brace yourselves for a journey through the quirkiest corners of code, where even a one-fingered, half-braincell approach can yield results (well, sort of).

## Java Classes Turbo 🚀
Behold, the most advanced Java classes known to humanity, courtesy of the one and only "best" Java tutor. Dive deep into the enigmatic depths of the code, where sanity is optional, and logic is a distant memory.

## Small Lebowski's Domain 🪓
Mr. Big's realm, lovingly referred to as "Small Lebowski," is a place where the teacher's eccentricities reign supreme. Expect the unexpected as you navigate the mind-bending lectures of the quirkiest teacher around. Here, exotic programming languages are taboo, and fire still terrifies Mr. Big.

## The Mr. Big Code Doctrine 📜
- **No Exotic Languages:** Mr. Big's code dictionary is limited, so stick to the basics, or risk confusion.
- **Don't Deviate:** Dare not stray from his prescribed path. Copy-paste is the way to go, for forging your own code journey will only perplex him.
- **No Questions Allowed:** Never question his spaghetti code; it's the eighth wonder of the world, or so he thinks.

## How to Contribute (or Conform) 🤝
1. Fork the repo and journey into the abyss.
2. Code like you've never coded before (or simply follow the program to a T).
3. Make an offering to Mr. Big's code altar with a pull request.

## Credits (or Blame) 👏
Our eternal gratitude (or bewilderment) goes out to Mr. Big for leading us through this coding odyssey. We'll never be the same again.
